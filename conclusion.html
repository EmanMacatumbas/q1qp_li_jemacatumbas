            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <div class="contexttext">
                <p class="text">We have deduced that there are a few trends that appear when looking at the data. 
                    According to the data, it is within the Afro-Eurasia region where we can find more than 75% of 
                    the countries from the sample. We can thus infer that this region contains a large number of 
                    countries that exhibit factors that cause depression rates to increase. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="contexttext2">
                <p class="text">Another trend we have observed is that there are more “well-off” countries in the 
                    sample and depression seems to be a larger problem, or atleast is more prevalent, in countries 
                    of higher income level classes. This can be seen from the Qualitative variables I. & II. as well 
                    as Quantitative variable II. This was a surprise to us as we expected “worse-off” countries to be 
                    more common and have higher rates. This outcome could be due to a few reasons.

                    According to research, an increase in wealth does in fact correlate to an increase in psychological 
                    stress. This stress may derive from the pressure of high expectations and obligations towards one`s 
                    family and society. The article also confirms that “Research shows that wealthy countries do experience 
                    higher rates of depression, Marcum says.” It also states that “wealthier children of wealthy parents 
                    may have a higher chance of developing mental health conditions like depression and anxiety.” (Coelho, 2022).

                    Though this study only analyzes a small portion of countries and new trends may appear when studying the 
                    whole population, this study aims to assist future researchers to apply the results that we have found and 
                    formulate new studies to discover more ways in handling the issue at hand.
